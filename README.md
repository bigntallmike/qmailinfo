# qmailinfo
The goal is to create a library that allows easy analysis of qmail functionality.

Original tools from qmailanalog were wonderful but do not work well with modern logging,
and are quite lacking in finding specific information desired by a sysadmin like "what
happened to the messages sent to this person?"

Primary language is Python.
